# Meeting Notes – 2025-09-11

**Attendees:**  
- Madhuritha Alle
- Jacob Winter
- Gihwan Jung
- Nilesh Gupta

**Decisions & Agreements:**  
- Weekly meetings will take place **Thursdays from 1–2 PM**.  
- Meetings will be arranged with **Bruce** and **Travis** to:  
  - Review and understand existing code  
  - Potentially outline more specific stakeholder requirements  

**Sprint 1 Tasks (as outlined in Slack):**  
1. **Data Schema & Validation** – Define the structure of the DLC CSV files and implement code to validate them.  
2. **Server Setup** – Create a simple backend connected to a database (initial placeholder).  
3. **Client Scaffold** – Set up a basic front-end with a toolbar or sidebar as a placeholder.  

*Goal:*  
Get these foundations in place so that in **Sprint 2** we can start building real features on top of them (e.g., uploading a video, running analysis, and viewing results).  

**Future Planning:**  
- Discussed starting with a **GUI wrapped around Bruce’s code**.  
- Later, **refactor/tinker with Bruce’s code** to better fit project needs.  
- This direction depends on insights from the upcoming meeting with Bruce and the team’s deeper understanding of his code.  

**Action Items:**  
- [ ] Confirm Thursday 1–2 PM meeting slot with everyone  
- [ ] Schedule meetings with Bruce and Travis  
- [ ] Begin work on Sprint 1 tasks (schema, server, client)
