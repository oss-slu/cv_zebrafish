## Sprint 3 Planning
- **Core Calculations:**  
  - Nilesh will begin implementing foundational math into the repo.  
  - Focus areas: fin angles, head yaw, tail movement, and bout detection.

  - Finn will refactor `outputDisplay.py` so results (bout counts, averages, etc.) are returned as structured data instead of only printed to the terminal.  

- **Frontend:**  
  - Extend Jacob’s framework with a results panel to display summary outputs alongside graphs.  

- **Integration:**  
  - Plan to connect frontend ↔ CSV verifier ↔ database once pending PRs are merged.  

- **Documentation:**  
  - README update needed: project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples.
