Notes
Build on your draft: Incorporate feedback from your trial run
Practice together: The best presentations show evidence of rehearsal and coordination
Show, don't just tell: Demos and screenshots make your work tangible
Know your audience: Board members need different explanations than developers
Connect to strategy: Your Product Strategy should inform your narrative
Handle questions gracefully: Prepare for likely questions, admit what you don't know
Technical difficulties happen: Have backup plans (screenshots if live demo fails, etc.)
This represents your semester: Make it count
