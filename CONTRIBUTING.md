# 🚫 Contributions Not Accepted
To keep the project focused:

- Features requiring **raw video processing** (heatmap/video classifier not supported)
- Large architectural changes without discussion
- Private/proprietary data dumps
- PRs lacking explanation or context
- Unreviewed changes to LICENSE

---

# 📜 Ground Rules
All contributors must:

- Be respectful, collaborative, and constructive  
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized  
- Add docstrings for any new code  
- Follow PEP 8 (backend) and PyQt conventions (frontend)  
- Avoid hardcoded paths  
- Test changes thoroughly before submitting  
- Open an Issue for any major design changes  

---

# 🐣 First-Time Contributors
Start with issues labeled:

- `good first issue`

# 🚀 Getting Started

## 1️⃣ Fork & Clone

git clone https://github.com/oss-slu/cv_zebrafish.git

cd cv_zebrafish


## 2️⃣ Set Up the Conda Environment

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dlc

## 3️⃣ Run the Application

cd src/cvzebrafish/ui
python ../../app.py


This opens the PyQt interface for validation, metric calculation, and plotting.

⚠️ Heatmap/video features are **not implemented**.

---

# 🌿 Branching Workflow


git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>


Example commit messages:

feat: add spine metric calculations
fix: correct JSON schema validation logic
docs: add UI onboarding tutorial
refactor: clean plotting adapters


Push your branch:

git push origin feature/<your-feature-name>

# 🔁 Pull Requests

Before creating a PR:

- Ensure the app runs locally  
- Add docstrings & comments  
- Include screenshots (UI/plot changes)  
- Reference Issue numbers (`Fixes #17`)  
- Keep PRs focused on a single change  
- Provide sample input if needed  

PRs should include:

- Summary of the change  
- Why it’s needed  
- How to test it  
- Screenshots/logs (if UI-related)

# 🧪 Code Style Guidelines

### Backend
- `snake_case`
- PEP 8 formatting  
- Clear separation of validation / calculations / plotting  

### Frontend (PyQt)
- `camelCase` widget names  
- Minimal business logic in UI  
- Reusable components under `components/`  
- Resources stored in `resources/`

# 🐞 Reporting Bugs

Include:

- Error logs  
- Sample CSV/JSON  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected vs actual behavior  
- OS/environment details  


---

# 🔐 Obvious Fix Policy
You may submit without an Issue:

- Typos  
- Docstring updates  
- Small UI layout fixes  
- Logging improvements  
- Minor formatting changes  

Anything larger → open an Issue first.
